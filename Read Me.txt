NFS Underground 2 - Extra Options - Build 1
Made by nlgzrgn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
(Every option can be edited from .ini file.)

--Lap and opponent count restrictions are modified.
> You can have from 0 (which makes the race unlimited) to 127 (Really long races) laps.
> Maximum opponents are now limited with 5 instead of 3. More than 6 players will crash the game.
! These options are valid for LAN races, too.

--Drift multiplier can now be modified up to x9.
> The default value was x5. You can revert it back if you want, or use x1 for more challenging drift races.

--You can change the appearance of Drift Points.
> Add a + sign in front of them to make it like "Power Slide", "Hang Time" or "Hydros".
> Show it without multiplying, Instead of 1500, have it 500x3 like "Avoided Accident" or "Clear Section".

--You can unlock cars from PAL version (Peugeot 106 and Opel Corsa) for the NTSC version of the game.
> They will be available at Customize Menu and Career Car Lot.
! You must have the files for these cars (PEUGOT106 and CORSA folders) on your CARS folder. Otherwise, this option will not work.
! I've also added an option to unlock all the cars from the beginning! (Start the career with a RX7, huh?)

--You can select a track for Free Run (9) game mode.
> It has a very long list! Just try it.

--You can have every track on every game mode.
> This will make the list too long. After some races, icons won't scroll. But you can select the races safely.
! If you select a track which doesn't exist in game files, it'll be replaced with 4000 (Free Roam) while you're on track options screen.
! If you select a Sprint Drift (Or, Drift races from Jackson Heights) for another game mode, your game will crash when you finish the race.

--You can remove the neon barriers.
> Locked area barriers or route indicators, remove if you don't want them!
